# Restaurant_Menu
This is one of tasks I was working on in "Software Tester" course. It is simply a function that asks a user what budget is he/she want to spend on a restaurant meals.
After that there are some options which depends on the user's answer. When the user gives answer the menu is chosen and displayed.
